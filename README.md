When you’re scared or feeling blue
There is something you can do
There’s a place that you can go
That is always filled with joy
 
It’s right here, in my heart
Always safe and never far
I look around and then I see
Many faces that make me feel...Happy!
What makes you happy?
 
When daddy tickles me, it makes me happy
When mommy gives a hug, it makes me happy
When grandpa blows a kiss, it makes me happy
When Bingo rolls around, it makes me happy
 
It’s right here, in your heart
Always safe and never far
Look around and you will see
Lots of things that make you feel...Happy!
What makes you happy?
 
When we build a blanket fort, it makes me happy
When we make a bed of pillows, it makes me happy
When we’re safe inside our fort, it makes me happy
When all the stars are bright, it makes me happy
 
It’s right here, in your heart
Always safe and never far
Look around and you will see
Lots of things that make you feel...Happy!
What makes you happy?
 
When I hug my teddy bear, it makes me happy
When I get a goodnight kiss, it makes me happy
When I’m drinking hot cocoa, it makes me happy
The moments like this, they make me happy
 
When you’re scared or feeling blue
There is something you can do
There’s a place that you can go
That is always filled with joy
